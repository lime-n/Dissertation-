# Dissertation

Included are all the R programming scripts that I have used towards my dissertation, and more that helped me get there.

The 'and more' part, involve word documents of note-taking to help me better understand and inspire myself into understanding what I needed as a next step in programming the right function for my objective.

This dissertation includes familiarity with machine learning, calibration models, linear regression, and covariate analysis with eBird citizen science data.
